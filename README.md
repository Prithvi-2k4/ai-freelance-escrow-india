# AI-Powered Freelancing Platform for the Indian Market

## Overview
This project aims to build a secure and localized freelancing marketplace designed specifically for the Indian gig economy.  
The platform addresses common challenges faced by freelancers and clients such as trust issues, payment risks, high commission fees, and the lack of AI-driven recommendations.  

## Objectives
- Develop an AI-powered system for job and talent matching.  
- Provide escrow-based payments with support for UPI and Indian banking (simulated for prototype).  
- Implement role-based dashboards for freelancers and clients.  
- Enable portfolio and file uploads for work samples and deliverables.  
- Support the complete project lifecycle from job posting to proposal submission, task assignment, and final delivery.  
- Include project management and communication tools within the platform.  

## Technology Stack
**Frontend**  
- React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

**Backend**  
- Node.js with Express.js  
- JWT for authentication  
- Multer for file uploads  

**Database**  
- MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose  

**Deployment & Tools**  
- Render (free tier) for hosting  
- Git and GitHub for version control  

## Innovation
- Simulated escrow payment gateway to demonstrate secure transaction flow without real money.  
- AI-powered job and freelancer matching based on skills, profiles, and job descriptions.  
- Role-based dashboards with tailored experiences for freelancers and employers.  
- Cloud-hosted prototype built entirely using free-tier and open-source tools.
